# review-of-remote-areas
OpenStreetMap is vastly inaccurate in remote parts of the county. This project will review the data and correct where appropriate.

Could be a situation where we create an Overpass Turbo query to check for any highways not editing in the last five years.

This could be fixed by taking on MapRoulette tasks. Here's a [start near Acton](http://maproulette.org/map/237/316656).

## Next steps
1. Determine areas with great need of road review
2. Build out one or multiple MapRoulette tasks
3. Fix all the roads!
