# review-of-remote-areas
OpenStreetMap is vastly inaccurate in remote parts of the county (see [here](http://www.openstreetmap.org/edit#map=16/34.5248/-118.2921) for an example). This project will review the data and correct where appropriate.

Could be a situation where we create an Overpass Turbo query to check for any highways not editing in the last five years.

We've created a test MapRoulette project while the project is still in beta. [Check it out](http://maproulette.org:8080/map/237).
